This shader is built on top of the Shadow Tutorial template found here:
https://github.com/shaderLABS/Shadow-Tutorial
many thanks to ShaderLabs, and you can use that shader as a great starting point to learn and edit to make your own shader.


If you want to learn to make shaders I also started a video series here:

If the texture upscaling looks broken on certain things, you can whitelist mobs for filter fixes, or blacklist them from upscaling, in the 'entity.properties' file. If you tell me the names, I'll include them in the next update.
